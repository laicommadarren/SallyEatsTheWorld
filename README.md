## Overview

I love to explore regional foods and all types of cuisine. I wanted to be able to share that and allow others to have an easier time to learn about and try foods that may not be familiar.

This prototype app showcases dishes from different restaurants across Los Angeles, and gives a background for each dish featured. It also allows users to find the associated restaurant on yelp to access more information including restaurant location to be able to try it.

This app is suitable for people who may not typically be adventurous with trying new food but want a way to learn about dishes to help give them an idea of what to expect. It can also be used to learn about local cuisine offerings and learning about their backgrounds.
